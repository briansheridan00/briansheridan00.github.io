        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          A recent graduate from a Master's of Physics from ETH Zürich. 
          I am passionate about research, astrophysics, 
          machine learning and languages.
        </p>

        <p><b>Education:</b></p> 
        <ul>
        <li>MSc Physics – ETH Zürich (2022–2024)</li>
        <li>BSc Theoretical Physics – University College Dublin (2018–2022)</li>
        </ul> 

        <p><b>Detail</b></p> 
        <p>
          My interest in physics has always been close to me, where I was always fascinated 
          by the power of equations in predicting the world around us, taking great joy in 
          pursuing this during my university education. This fascination 
          is supplemented by an admiration for computational techniques which bring to life the equations 
          we create (or discover!). I have always held the field of astrophysics in high esteem, 
          taking inspiration in the monumental scales involved. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I take great interest in machine learning, which captures my imagination in
          its broad application and power. I try to deepen my understanding of it 
          whenever I can and apply this powerful tool in projects. I am also interested in the 
          world of finance and find that it offers a powerful and complex view into our society. 
          The physics techniques in understanding the natural world can act as excellent tools in 
          refining our understanding of this artificial world we have built around us.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my free time I enjoy hiking and spending time in the mountains or by the seaside.
          Additionally, I am captivated by linguistics and learning languages. I'm currently expanding
          my understanding of the German language and enjoy learning about 
          the various idioms and grammatical nuances.
